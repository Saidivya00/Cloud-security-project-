# 🔐 Cloud Security Implementation – IAM, Secure Storage & Encryption

This project demonstrates the implementation of essential cloud security best practices, including **IAM policies**, **secure storage configuration**, and **data encryption**, on a cloud platform. The setup ensures strict access control, confidentiality, and compliance with data protection standards.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To implement and document:
- IAM policies that enforce least privilege access  
- Secure cloud storage configurations  
- Data encryption (at rest and in transit)  
All within a secure and compliant cloud environment.

---

## ☁️ Platform Used

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)

---

## 🛠️ Services & Tools Involved

- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**  
- **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**  
- **KMS (Key Management Service)**  
- **CloudTrail (Audit Logging)**  
- **CloudWatch (Security Monitoring)**

---

## 🔐 Security Features Implemented

### ✅ IAM Policies
- Created custom IAM roles with least privilege permissions  
- Blocked access to sensitive resources using resource-based policies  
- Attached policies to specific services only (EC2, S3, Lambda)

### ✅ Secure Storage (S3)
- Enabled bucket-level encryption  
- Configured block public access on all buckets  
- Applied bucket policies to restrict access by IAM user or service

### ✅ Data Encryption
- Used SSE-KMS (Server-Side Encryption with KMS) on S3  
- Encrypted sensitive parameters using AWS KMS CMK  
- Verified that all logs and backups are encrypted
